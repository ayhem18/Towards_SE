# Overview
This is currently simply a clone of the project described in the [online Tutorial Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzMcBGfZo4-kCLWnGmK0jUBmGLaJxvi4j)

## Main Goal:

* Get an overview of the big picture: how is the backend (Django) linked with the frontend (React)
* The project described here is minimalistic.
    1. Using only one Model: the host / guests are modeled with string fields
    2. No auth system
