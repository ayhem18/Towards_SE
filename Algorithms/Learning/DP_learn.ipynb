    "Let's start with a very simple way to evaluate both time and space complexity for the recursive version of the function:\n",
    "1. Time complexity: We have T(n) = T(n - 1) + T(n - 2). Well it is important to picture the tree. If we have T_1(n) = 2 * T(n - 1). Then, we have a tree of depth $n$ generated for every call of $n$. Then $T(n) = O(2 ^ n)$. Assuming, we have $T_2(n) = 2 * T(n - 2)$, then we have a tree of depth $\\frac{n}{2}$, evaluating the time complexity to $O(2^{\\frac{n}{2}}) = O(2 ^ n)$. Using the simple fact that $T_1(n) >= T(n) >= T_2(n)$ reveals the answer\n",
    "2. Space complexity: Again back to the tree: The function $f(n)$ keeps only  $f(n - 1)$, $f(n - 2)$ ... $f(1)$ in the call stack: Think about it in terms of path from the caller to the base case: Space complexity in this case is $O(n)$\n",

    "Let's consider the canSum problem and analyze its time and space complexity. The idea here is find the depth of the tree (any recursive problem can be modeled as a tree)\n",
    "as well as the branching factor. The first step: is the depth, The longest path is $target / min(values)$ where values is the values. This is linear in terms of $m$. As for the branching factor, it is the size of the array which can be denoted by $n$. Thus, the time complexity for the recursive version of the solution is $O(n ^ m)$"
