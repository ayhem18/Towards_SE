    "* the internet protocol is a mechanism to assign a $4$ bytes to a machine connected to the Internet. This address is crucial to transfer data from servers to clients (which are generally browsers). Certain IP addresses are reserved for specific use-cases such as 127.0.0.1 : which refers the machine to itself.  \n",
    "* One false impression about IP addresses is that they are static. but they aren't. a certain organization is taking care of organizing the distribuation of IP addresses. The same organization announced the birth of a new era of the Internet Protocol as all the previous 4-bytes address were already occupied. \n",
    "* One important note: IP $\\neq$ machine. It took me a while to see this.  A router masks the IP address of the local network. In other words, any request generated by a local computer is associated with the router's IP address. So to the outside world, each and every computer have the same IP address.\n",
    "* the distribution of IP addresses is hierarchical. The associated sells ranges of IP address to certain Telecommunication companies. Those distribute the ranges even further accross regions or countries. Thus, a certain IP address is tightly associated with the geographical location: the efficiency: 99% country-wise, 95% city-wise.\n",

    "* a good point to keep in mind is IP addresses are in the majority of cases not static. For example, the Internet Service Providers (generally abbreviated to ISPs) generally acquire a set of shared IP addresses. They are distributed between the users dynamically. Such process is definitely more cost-efficient. Websites and companies cannot afford to work with dynamic IP addresses as it might intervene with their DNS queries. \n",
