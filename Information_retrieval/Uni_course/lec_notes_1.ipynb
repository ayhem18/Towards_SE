    "* the internet protocol is a mechanism to assign a $4$ bytes to a machine connected to the Internet. This address is crucial to transfer data from servers to clients (which are generally browsers). Certain IP addresses are reserved for specific use-cases such as 127.0.0.1 : which refers the machine to itself.  \n",
    "* One false impression about IP addresses is that they are static. but they aren't. a certain organization is taking care of organizing the distribuation of IP addresses. The same organization announced the birth of a new era of the Internet Protocol as all the previous 4-bytes address were already occupied. \n",
